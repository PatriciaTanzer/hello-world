# hello-world

I like dogs, can't keep a fish alive to save my life, and cats make me sneeze.
I play the organ, the piano, the harpsichord - anything with a keyboard. I used to play the recorder and flute.
I rely on copious amounts of coffee and reward myself for good work by watching Game of Thrones.
Hello World, are you ready?
