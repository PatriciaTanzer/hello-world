# hello-world

I like dogs, can't keep a fish alive to save my life, and cats make me sneeze.
I play the organ, the piano, the harpsichord - anything with a keyboard. 
I speak Spanish roughly, and German well enough.
I rely on copious amounts of coffee and my weekly Dnd se...ah, I mean, interactive therapy sessions. Yeah. That's totally what those are.
Hola, Hallo, Hello.
